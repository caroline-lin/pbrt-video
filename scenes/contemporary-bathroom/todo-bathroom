current status:
got the polytope to finally render-in place!
tested by angling the camera in the x direction only, 
drawing a sphere, and translating the coordinates 1 by 1.

quirks about the scene:
the camera eye look-at point is by default actually pointing out of the scene.
the entire washroom is roughly within a 2x1x1 rectangular prism.
pbrt *does* render shapes when they intersect; if you don't see the shape, then it's probably because it's being occluded
by some other object, or because camera is not pointing at it.
using environment camera doesn't work very well. pbrt gets a segfault for this scene.
every object has its translation, scaling etc. hard-coded into the scene.

what's next:
1. turn bathroom pbrt file into a template.
move.pbrt is best option for this. it has correct shape placements. 
if you need to reset the camera coords, diff it with lower.pbrt.

2. comment out sphere code, and delete extra dodecahedrons in geometry.pbrt.

3. move lighting code to be after the geometry includes, so errors go away.
I think the errors are occurring because John Doe is putting the light declarations before the custom materials are declared.

4. modify andy's code so that the video generation takes the bathroom file as a template.
this may take some time; see if you can check in with andy.

5. refactor and tweaks.
this includes better lighting for the scene, and playing around with different materials and textures.

6. Figure out why default meshlab transform method from earlier didn't work, and write down solution.

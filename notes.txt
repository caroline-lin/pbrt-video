TODO
----

- DONE Make the template shorter; use Include instead

- DONE Make the .pbrt files in _out


4D Visualization
----------------

- DONE line + plane intersection

- add line segments

- generate line segments for a cube
  1. enumerate vertices
  2a. test all pairs of vertices for length 1
  2b. if it's aligned to origin, cheaper test

- intersect all edges of cube with plane
  => set of points

- iterate over d  (multiple planes)
  - generate .pbrt file for each d
  - each point of intersection becomes a sphere

- fill in the intersection points to make a solid triangle

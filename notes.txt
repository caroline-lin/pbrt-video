4D Visualization

- DONE line + plane intersection

- add line segments

- generate line segments for a cube
  1. enumerate vertices
  2a. test all pairs of vertices for length 1
  2b. if it's aligned to origin, cheaper test

- intersect all edges of cube with plane
  => set of points

- iterate over d  (multiple planes)
  - generate .pbrt file for each d
  - each point of intersection becomes a sphere

- fill in the intersection points to make a solid triangle

Math
----

Use the parametric form.  Represent a line as 2 points.  Represent a Plane
with a normal and a point on the plane .

Then there is a closed form solution for t.  If t in [0,1], then it's between
the 2 points!  So the line segment works.

Do we then need a plane / hyperplane intersection in 4D?

Hm POVRay has unions?  That makes it easy?  So you don't have to use a
trianglemesh?

http://paulbourke.net/geometry/platonic/dodecahedron.pov

NOTE: killeroo model is "loopsubdiv"

Would we use "trianglemesh"?  Then we need an algorithm for enumerating the
vertices in order?

TODO
----

- use 11 cores instead of 12?  22 hyperthreads

- experiment with the rendering params and find a good quality/speed tradeoff
  - not sure what integrator depth does yet!

- in _out/4d/remote-bathroom, save the parameters somewhere?
  - that is, don't delete any of the .png or the .mp4 

- optional:
  - rotate the 3d slice as its growing
  - or just rotate/pan the camera?
  - more than one shape in the scene

- trim off the first frame since it seems degenerate?  There's a jump, not
  smooth.

- loop the video: https://video.stackexchange.com/questions/16919/is-it-possible-to-create-a-continuously-looping-video
  - using html5 <video> ?
  - or just an mp4 tag?

------



- DONE find an animation example with matplotlib
- DONE Do a video with frames generated in matplotlib?
  - Just translate and rotate the polytope through the x-y axis

- Do shading of convex hull example
  - Does this let you see the shape better?  Not sure.

- DONE Change 3d / plane intersection to be a translation/rotation and then
  projection along the x-y axis.  This is so the convex hull algorithm will
  have 2d points to work with.

- DONE Test out 4d / hyperplane intersection, do 3d convex hull
- DONE Then render a .pbrt file
  - with some kind of material:
    - metal
    - translucent glass
    - subsurface scattering?

4D Visualization
----------------

- DONE line + plane intersection

- add line segments

- generate line segments for a cube
  1. enumerate vertices
  2a. test all pairs of vertices for length 1
  2b. if it's aligned to origin, cheaper test

- intersect all edges of cube with plane
  => set of points

- iterate over d  (multiple planes)
  - generate .pbrt file for each d
  - each point of intersection becomes a sphere

- fill in the intersection points to make a solid triangle

Math
----

Use the parametric form.  Represent a line as 2 points.  Represent a Plane
with a normal and a point on the plane .

Then there is a closed form solution for t.  If t in [0,1], then it's between
the 2 points!  So the line segment works.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line%E2%80%93plane_intersection

Do we then need a plane / hyperplane intersection in 4D?
Or face / hyperplane intersection?

I think the 4D version is:

- Enumerate edges (not faces or hyperfaces) of 4D polytope
  - These are lines in 4 space.  So p1 = (x,y,z,w) and p2 = (x,y,z,w)
- intersect with a volume
  - how many cases are there?  line/plane intersection has 3 cases: 0
    (parallel), 1, and all (contained in plane)

Hm POVRay has unions?  That makes it easy?  So you don't have to use a
trianglemesh?

http://paulbourke.net/geometry/platonic/dodecahedron.pov

NOTE: killeroo model is "loopsubdiv"

Would we use "trianglemesh"?  Then we need an algorithm for enumerating the
vertices in order?

SymPy already has models, like Mathematica.  Maybe just use those, and later
make our own.  Hm they only have 3 symmetry groups: tetrahedral, octahedral,
and icosahedral
